**ERC777**

ERC777 is considered a new or upgraded version of ERC20 2.0. It incorporates hooks within the contract that trigger another contract. This feature is similar to what ERC1155 offers with its Receiver. However, ERC777 introduces certain vulnerabilities in the way it updates state. By utilizing hooks that invoke a contract after a token transfer, it opens up potential loopholes. For instance, if Alice designates Bob as the implementer, every time Bob receives a token, Alice will trigger the hook. This creates a vulnerability to reentrancy, as Alice could potentially revert Bob's transaction.

**ERC1363**

ERC1363 is regarded as an improvement over ERC777, offering a safer alternative known as SafeERC20. It behaves more like a conventional ERC20 contract, supporting the execution of recipient code after a transfer function or a transferFrom. The objective of this EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is to facilitate code execution immediately following a transfer function, a feature lacking in ERC777. It introduces functions such as `transferAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall`, which enable callbacks immediately after a `transfer` or `transferFrom` operation.
