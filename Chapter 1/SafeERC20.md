** Why does the SafeERC20 program exist and when should it be used? **

The SafeERC20 program exist because of a lack of safety on the current ERC20. For example the ERC20 transfer and transferFrom doesnt return a bool if a transaction fail or success. This would not be able to be identify if a transaction succeed or fail. The SafeERC20 Program made by oppenzepplin made this so well where it decode the return data and check if its true. Second there is a possibility of a double spend on ERC20 since lets say Alice set an allowance for Bob 1100 then try to send another trasaction to set the correct amount to 1000 then Bob could just take 1100 first then get the second 1000 from the second transaction which allows Bob to get double. Since SafeERC20 is a wrapper of the ERC20 then it should only be use when a contract is trying to interact with an ERC20 contract. This will allow a much more safe interaction.
